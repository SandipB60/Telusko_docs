x=5
Memory space of type "int" is allocated and a name "x" is tagged to the memory space.

something behae like a duck is a duck. (walks like duck, swims like duct... it is duck)
Dynamic typing in python.
To run code we need "ide" and "ide" must have the "same" "execute" behavior. Then both the different "Pycharm" and "MyEditor" birds can "execute" behaviour.

Same name "ide" with two different instances/memory spases of the types/classes ("Pycharm" and "MyEditor") but have same behaviour ("execute")

class Pycharm:
    def execute(self):
        print("Compiling")
        print("Running")

class MyEditor:
    def execute(self):
        print("Spell Check")
        print("Convention Check")
        print("Compiling")
        print("Running")

class Laptop:
    def code(self,ide):
        ide.execute()

print("------Pycharm------")
ide=Pycharm()
lap1=Laptop()
lap1.code(ide)
print("------MyEditor------")
ide=MyEditor()
lap1=Laptop()
lap1.code(ide)
print("------end------")
